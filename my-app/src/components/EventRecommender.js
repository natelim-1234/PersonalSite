                                While existing applications like Whova offer robust tools for event scheduling and networking, their generalized design introduces many distractions, making it difficult for users to quickly tailor their experience to specific events. 
                                Additionally, Whova lacks AI-driven recommendation tools that could assist users in effortlessly creating an optimized, personalized schedule.

                        <p> 
                            We began by mapping out Whova's complete user flow, from onboarding and event discovery to session selection. 
                            This process revealed that while Whova offers a broad set of features, its generalized design often introduces cognitive friction for users whose primary goal is simply to build an effective event schedule.
                            At most, there were six user decisions and a lengthy repetitive process of selecting and viewing sessions individually in order for users to complete their schedule creation.

                        <p> 
                            By starting with a competitor's complex flow and stripping it down to its essentials, we laid the foundation for a scheduling experience that is both intuitive and tailored to users. 
                            We removed most of the cognitive friction by using our trained AI to create a schedule that pertains to our user's interest. 
                            When a user is not satisfied with their schedule, they can use our AI recommendation feature to produce a list of sessions that are ordered by relevance to their interests to easily find what they are looking for.
                            These functions greatly reduces the amount of reading and cognitive load the user must perform in order to assemble their schedule.

                            Our passion project, the schedule recommender application, released successfully on our company LinkedIn page.
                            Due to the time restraints of the project, there was not enough time to implement everything that we aimed to acheive.
                            If we had more time, we would have liked to implement a more conversational chat experience so that users could probe the AI for further insights.
