                                To complete this project in a timely manner before our company attends the 2024 Microsoft Ignite conference, I held daily meetings with the CEO and project leads to better understand the vision and message of the new website.
                                I then interpreted these requests into actionable sprint items and created a plan to complete website development before the provided deadline.

                                I first deconstructed the website's information architecture to better understand the pitfalls of our current design.
                                 From here, I began a competitive analysis of other consulting company websites to see how information for services could be presented in a more understandable manner.
                                 I then combined our own original ideas with designs from our competitive analysis to create a website mockup that fit our requirements.

                            <p> 
                                The past website lacked design cohesion which made it difficult for users to intuitively read or navigate from page to page.
                                In order to solve this problem, we redesigned the whole website using the Microsoft Fluent UI design system as a reference point while making our own tweaks along the way to make our own style.
                            </p>

                            <p>           
                                By unifying our style, users were able to easily navigate the website which lead to an overall 40% increase in activity on our services and product pages.

                            <p>
                                We used a third party app to identify which parts of the old website users clicked on the most and how long it took for them to view this information. We found that users were most interested in viewing our services and products, but were having to scroll further down the website to find this information which lead to users leaving the page out of frustration.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To improve the user experience, we moved all information for the company services and products to the top of the home page. Each service and product was ordered based on popularity so users could easily find what they are looking for.
